# PuckFutin

An Arduino project, run on a NodeMCU, driving a string of NeoPixels to light up the front of my house while transmitting a message in morse code.

It includes some Morse code encoded letters as an example, and transmits the sentence PuckFutin over an over again.

This is a pared down portion of a much larger project.  I am happy to refactor and improve commenting if there is interest in using this code.
